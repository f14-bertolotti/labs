    "## 1. The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Your data is split across several disks across several computers connected by a network. And, probably, all your data combined take so much space that they would never fit a single computer. On the other hand, you still need to process your data. Well, without proper infrastructure, you would need to track down each piece of information, process them separately, and combine the information together. On top of that, you will need to repeat this process many times, too many times. \n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) solves most of these problems. It provides also MapReduce API to do the processing. However, the MapReduce API is still very low-level, and getting things done requires too much time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is where Spark comes into play. Spark provides high-level APIs for large-scale data processing. Spark can run over an existing HDFS or it can run in a standalone mode (which does not require setting up any HDFS). To be fair, Spark in standalone mode is not particularly useful but it provides an easy way to access its functionalities and test them. Moreover, whatever code you write in standalone mode that runs on your laptop will work automatically on huge HDFS. \n",

    "### 2. Spark Context\n",
    "\n",
    "The [SparkContext] represents the entry point to access spark functionalities. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the Spark framework, there are two main actors: the driver and the executors. The driver has jobs that need to be run. The driver splits jobs into tasks. These tasks are submitted to executors. Once completed, results are sent back to the driver. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will run Spark in local mode, so that, we can avoid running a whole HDFS on our machine. We will focus mainly on the programming paradigm. However, it may be useful to know that platforms such as [DataBricks] do exist. They simplify a lot of the work necessary to set up a real cluster on which spark can run. \n",

One task is launched for each partition, as shown in the example below. A task is a unit of execution that runs on a single machine. When we run ```map(f)``` within a partition, a new task applies ```f``` to all of the entries in a particular partition and outputs a new partition.

    "## 6. Additional Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "* [flatMap]: `flatMap(f)` returns a new RDD by first applying `f` to all elements of this RDD, and then flattening the results.\n",
    "* [groupByKey]: `groupByKey()` Groups the values for each key in the RDD into a single sequence. This transformation operates on pair RDDs.  \n",
    "* [reduceByKey]:  `reduceByKey(func)` Merges the values for each key using an associative and commutative reduce function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these transformations ([groupByKey] and [reduceByKey]) operate on pair RDDs.  A pair RDD is an RDD where each element is a pair tuple (key, value).  For example, `sc.parallelize([('a', 1), ('a', 2), ('b', 1)])` would create a pair RDD where the keys are 'a', 'a', 'b' and the values are 1, 2, 1.\n",
    "The `reduceByKey()` transformation gathers together pairs that have the same key and applies a function to two associated values at a time. `reduceByKey()` operates by applying the function first within each partition on a per-key basis and then across the partitions.\n",
    "While both the `groupByKey()` and `reduceByKey()` transformations can often be used to solve the same problem and will produce the same answer, the `reduceByKey()` transformation works much better for large distributed datasets. This is because Spark knows it can combine output with a common key on each partition *before* shuffling (redistributing) the data across nodes.  Only use `groupByKey()` if the operation would not benefit from reducing the data before the shuffle occurs.\n",
    " \n",
    "Look at the diagram below to understand how `reduceByKey` works.  Notice how pairs on the same machine with the same key are combined (by using the lamdba function passed into reduceByKey) before the data is shuffled. Then the lamdba function is called again to reduce all the values from each partition to produce one final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, when using the `groupByKey()` transformation - all the key-value pairs are shuffled around, causing a lot of unnecessary data to be transferred over the network.\n",
    " \n",
    "To determine which machine to shuffle a pair to, Spark calls a partitioning function on the key of the pair. Spark spills data to disk when there is more data shuffled onto a single executor machine than can fit in memory. However, it flushes out the data to disk one key at a time, so if a single key has more key-value pairs than can fit in memory an  out-of-memory exception occurs. This will be more gracefully handled in a later release of Spark so that the job can still proceed, but should still be avoided.  When Spark needs to spill to disk, performance is severely impacted.\n",

However, memory is limited, so if you try to keep too many RDDs in memory, Spark will automatically delete RDDs from memory to make space for new RDDs. If you later refer to one of the RDDs, Spark will automatically recreate the RDD for you, but that takes time.\n",

Keep in mind that if you cache too many RDDs and Spark runs out of memory, it will delete the least recently used (LRU) RDD first. Again, the RDD will be automatically recreated when accessed.\n",
